# 🎯 The Vision — Senior Full-Stack Engineer

## Mission Statement

> **Hire a senior full-stack engineer for our seed-stage startup. We need someone who can own features end-to-end (design to deployment), work autonomously, and thrive in ambiguity. Target: extend offer within 30 days.**

- **Team size:** Engineer #3 (2 co-founders + this hire)
- **Stage:** Seed ($2M raised, 12 months runway)

## Priority Order
