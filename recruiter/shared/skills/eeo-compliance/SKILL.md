# Skill: EEO Compliance

## Purpose
Ensure the hiring process complies with equal employment opportunity requirements and is free from unlawful discrimination.

## Key Regulations

| Law | Protects | Applies To |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| Title VII (Civil Rights Act) | Race, color, religion, sex, national origin | Employers with 15+ employees |
| ADEA (Age Discrimination) | Age (40+) | Employers with 20+ employees |
| ADA (Americans with Disabilities) | Disability | Employers with 15+ employees |
| GINA | Genetic information | Employers with 15+ employees |
| OFCCP | Federal contractor obligations | Federal contractors/subcontractors |
| State/local laws | Varies — often broader protections | Check by jurisdiction |

## 4/5ths Rule (Adverse Impact Analysis)

The selection rate for any protected group should be at least 80% (4/5) of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate.

**Example:**
- Group A: 60 applicants, 30 selected = 50% selection rate
- Group B: 40 applicants, 10 selected = 25% selection rate
- Ratio: 25% / 50% = 50% — **below 80% threshold → adverse impact flagged**

**When to run:** After screening stage, after interview stage, and at final decision.

**Note:** Adverse impact is a statistical indicator, not proof of discrimination. It triggers further investigation, not automatic changes.

## Interview Question Red Lines

### Never Ask About:
- Age, date of birth
- Marital status, children, pregnancy plans
- Religion, religious practices
- National origin, citizenship (can ask about work authorization)
- Disability, medical conditions
- Genetic information, family medical history
- Sexual orientation, gender identity (protected in many jurisdictions)
- Arrest record (conviction inquiries allowed in some jurisdictions, with restrictions)

### Acceptable Alternatives:
| Don't Ask | Do Ask |
|-----------|--------|
| "How old are you?" | "Are you at least 18?" |
| "Do you have kids?" | "Are you available for the required schedule?" |
| "Where are you from?" | "Are you authorized to work in [country]?" |
| "Do you have any disabilities?" | "Can you perform the essential functions of this role with or without accommodation?" |

## Documentation Requirements

For every hiring decision, document:
1. Criteria used (from role definition)
2. How each candidate was evaluated against criteria
3. Scores and reasoning for advance/reject decisions
4. Any accommodations requested and provided
5. Final decision rationale

## Process

1. Review JDs before posting — flag biased language
2. Review interview questions before use — flag illegal topics
3. Track pipeline demographics when data is available
4. Run 4/5ths analysis at each stage with sufficient data
5. Flag adverse impact indicators with recommendations
6. Maintain compliance documentation for each search
