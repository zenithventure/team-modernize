# Skill: Job Description Writing

## Purpose
Write job descriptions that are compelling, specific, inclusive, and accurately represent the role.

## Structure

```
# [Role Title]

## About [Company]
2-3 sentences. What the company does, stage, mission. Honest, not marketing speak.

## The Role
What this person will actually do day-to-day. Be specific.
"You'll own the checkout flow end-to-end" > "You'll work on exciting projects."

## What You'll Do (First 90 Days)
3-5 concrete deliverables. Helps candidates self-select.

## What We're Looking For
Must-haves only. Keep this list short (5-7 items max).
Every requirement must be truly necessary for the role.

## Nice to Have
Things that would be great but aren't required.

## What We Offer
Compensation range (required in many states), benefits, work arrangement.
Be specific: "$120K-$150K base + equity" > "competitive compensation."

## How to Apply
Clear instructions. What to submit, what to expect, timeline.
```

## Anti-Bias Language Guide

### Replace These

| Biased | Better | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| "rockstar" / "ninja" / "guru" | "experienced" / "skilled" | Gendered connotations, discourages diverse applicants |
| "young and energetic" | "motivated and driven" | Age discrimination (ADEA) |
| "digital native" | "comfortable with technology" | Age proxy |
| "culture fit" | "values alignment" | Often used to exclude different backgrounds |
| "fast-paced environment" | describe actual pace | Vague, can discourage candidates with disabilities |
| "must have 10+ years" | describe actual skill level needed | Arbitrary, may not reflect actual requirements |
| "native English speaker" | "strong English communication skills" | National origin discrimination |
| "able-bodied" | remove unless genuinely required | Disability discrimination |

### Requirement Audit

For each requirement, ask:
1. Is this actually necessary to do the job?
2. Could someone without this still succeed?
3. Does this requirement disproportionately exclude any group?
4. Is there a less restrictive alternative?

Example: "CS degree required" → Does the role actually need a degree, or does it need the skills a degree might provide? If skills, say "strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms."

## Tone Guidelines

- Write at an 8th-grade reading level
- Use "you" and "we" — it's a conversation, not a legal document
- Be honest about challenges ("this role involves on-call rotation")
- Show, don't tell ("we shipped 47 features last quarter" > "we move fast")
- Include compensation range — it's increasingly required by law and candidates expect it
