# Skill: Candidate Screening

## Purpose
Evaluate candidates consistently against defined criteria to identify the strongest matches.

## Screening Framework

### 1. Define Criteria (Before Screening)
From VISION.md, extract:
- **Must-haves:** Non-negotiable requirements (immediately disqualify if missing)
- **Nice-to-haves:** Preferred but not required (add points, don't disqualify)
- **Dealbreakers:** Automatic rejection triggers

### 2. Resume Scoring

Score each candidate 1–5 on each criterion:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Exceeds requirement significantly |
| 4 | Meets requirement fully |
| 3 | Partially meets requirement |
| 2 | Weak match |
| 1 | Does not meet requirement |

### 3. Green Flags
- Experience directly relevant to the role's core challenges
- Progression showing growth (not just job hopping)
- Quantified achievements ("increased revenue 30%," not "responsible for revenue")
- Evidence of skills in action (open source, portfolio, case studies)
- Referrals from trusted sources

### 4. Red Flags (Investigate, Don't Auto-Reject)
- Frequent short tenures (<1 year) without explanation
- Vague descriptions of responsibilities
- Title inflation (VP at a 3-person company)
- Skills listed without context of application
- Resume inconsistencies (dates, titles)

**Important:** Red flags warrant investigation, not automatic rejection. There may be valid explanations.

### 5. Screening Decision

| Total Score | Decision |
|------------|----------|
| 80%+ of max | Strong advance — fast-track |
| 60–79% | Advance — standard pipeline |
| 40–59% | Borderline — discuss with team |
| <40% | Reject — send respectful decline |

## Process

1. Read VISION.md criteria before screening any candidates
2. Score each candidate independently (don't compare to others while scoring)
3. Document reasoning for each score
4. Submit scores and recommendations to pipeline
5. Reject candidates below threshold with respectful communication via Coordinator
