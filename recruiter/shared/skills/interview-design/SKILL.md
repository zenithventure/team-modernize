# Skill: Interview Design

## Purpose
Create structured interviews that predict job performance and enable fair comparison across candidates.

## Principles

1. **Same questions for all candidates** — enables fair comparison
2. **Behavioral over hypothetical** — "Tell me about a time when..." reveals more than "What would you do if..."
3. **Rubric before interview** — define what good/great/weak answers look like in advance
4. **Role-relevant only** — every question should map to a requirement from the role definition
5. **No trick questions** — the goal is to see candidates at their best, not trip them up

## Question Types by Role

### Technical Roles (Engineering, Data, etc.)
- **System design:** "How would you design [relevant system]?" — tests architectural thinking
- **Problem solving:** Live coding or take-home with clear rubric
- **Debugging:** "Here's a bug report. Walk me through how you'd investigate it."
- **Technical depth:** Deep-dive on their strongest area of expertise

### Business Roles (Sales, Marketing, Ops)
- **Case study:** Present a realistic scenario and ask for their approach
- **Metrics:** "How would you measure success for [initiative]?"
- **Past performance:** "Tell me about a time you [achieved relevant outcome]"
- **Stakeholder management:** "Describe a time you had to influence without authority"

### Leadership Roles
- **Team building:** "Tell me about a team you built. What worked? What would you change?"
- **Conflict resolution:** "Describe a significant disagreement with a peer. How did you resolve it?"
- **Strategy:** "How would you approach [specific challenge the company faces]?"
- **Decision making:** "Tell me about a decision you made with incomplete information"

## Rubric Template

For each question, define:

```
Question: [The question]
Maps to: [Which role requirement this evaluates]

5 - Strong: [What a strong answer includes]
3 - Acceptable: [What a passing answer includes]
1 - Weak: [What a weak answer looks like]

Red flags: [Answers that indicate poor fit]
```

## Interview Structure (60 minutes)

| Segment | Time | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Intro & rapport | 5 min | Set the candidate at ease, explain the process |
| Role overview | 5 min | What the role involves, what success looks like |
| Behavioral questions | 20 min | Past experience relevant to the role |
| Technical/functional | 20 min | Skills assessment specific to the role |
| Candidate questions | 10 min | Let them evaluate you — this is two-way |

## Anti-Bias Checklist

Before finalizing questions, verify:
- [ ] No questions that could elicit protected-class information
- [ ] No cultural knowledge requirements unrelated to the job
- [ ] Questions are accessible (no unnecessary jargon or acronyms)
- [ ] Rubric doesn't advantage any particular background
- [ ] Same questions and rubric used for all candidates
