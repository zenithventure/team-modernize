# Skill: Vision Sync

## Purpose
Stay aligned with the shared VISION.md and ensure all work contributes to the stated mission.

## Process

1. Read `shared/VISION.md` at the start of every session
2. Before starting any significant work, verify it aligns with the mission and priorities
3. When priorities conflict, follow the Priority Order defined in VISION.md
4. Update the "Team Working Notes" section of VISION.md when:
   - A key decision is made
   - The current phase changes
   - A blocker is identified or resolved
   - Active priorities shift

## Rules

- Never modify the Mission Statement, Success Criteria, Constraints, or Priority Order sections — those belong to the human
- The "Team Working Notes" section is maintained by the team
- If work doesn't align with the vision, raise it with the team before proceeding
