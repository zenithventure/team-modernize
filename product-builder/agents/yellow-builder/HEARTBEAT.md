# HEARTBEAT.md — Builder

## Implementation Check
- Any open GitHub Issues assigned to me?
- Any PRs waiting for fixes after QA review?
- Any branches that have been open too long (>2 days)?

## Build Health
- Does `npm run dev` still pass locally?
- Any dependency updates or security warnings?
- Any broken imports or TypeScript errors?

## Branch Hygiene
- Any merged branches that haven't been deleted?
- Is local main up to date with remote?

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
