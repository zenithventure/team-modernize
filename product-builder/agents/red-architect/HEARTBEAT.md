# HEARTBEAT.md — Architect

## Spec Currency Check
- Are all active specs up to date with latest requirements?
- Any PRs merged that invalidate current architecture docs?
- Any new feature requests that need spec work?

## Issue Backlog Health
- Are there enough sized GitHub Issues for Builder to stay productive?
- Any issues that are too large and need breaking down?

## Architecture Drift
- Has Builder introduced any tech or patterns not in the architecture doc?
- Any environment changes from Ops that affect the architecture?

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
