# 🎯 The Vision — Quarterly Portfolio Review

## Mission Statement

> **Conduct Q4 quarterly review of a 10-property multifamily portfolio across 3 markets. Analyze performance against budget, identify underperformers, flag maintenance and lease renewal risks, and deliver portfolio summary to the investment committee.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] All 10 properties' Q4 financials reviewed against budget
2. [ ] Variance analysis completed (actual vs. budget, YoY comparison)
3. [ ] Portfolio-level KPIs calculated and trended
4. [ ] Top 3 risks and opportunities identified
5. [ ] Portfolio summary delivered by January 20

## Constraints

- **Timeline:** Deliver by January 20 (financials available by January 5)
- **Scope:** Financial review only — no physical inspections this quarter
- **Human approval:** Investment committee reviews and decides on action items
- **Format:** Executive summary (2 pages) + property detail sheets
