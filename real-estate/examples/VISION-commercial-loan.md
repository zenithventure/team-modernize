# VISION: $5M Commercial Real Estate Loan Processing

## Objective
Process and underwrite a $5,000,000 commercial mortgage for a mixed-use property in downtown Denver.

## Loan Details
- **Borrower:** Mountain View Holdings LLC
- **Property:** 3-story mixed-use (retail ground floor, 12 residential units above)
- **Loan Amount:** $5,000,000
- **LTV Target:** 70%
- **Requested Term:** 10-year fixed
- **Amortization:** 30 years

## What We Need
1. Collect and verify all borrower and property documentation
2. Review T12 and 3-year financials for income stability
3. Analyze rent roll — residential vs. commercial income split
4. Calculate DSCR under current and stressed interest rates
5. Pull comparable sales to verify property valuation
6. Complete risk assessment and generate underwriting summary
7. Flag any deal-killing issues before committee presentation

## Key Concerns
- Retail vacancy risk in downtown Denver post-2024
- Borrower's other holdings and cross-collateralization
- Environmental history (former dry cleaner on adjacent lot)
- Residential rent control regulations in Denver
