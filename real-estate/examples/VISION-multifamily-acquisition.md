# VISION: 50-Unit Multifamily Acquisition

## Objective
Evaluate Parkview Gardens, a 50-unit garden-style apartment complex in suburban Atlanta, for potential acquisition at $4.2M asking price.

## Property Details
- **Address:** 1200 Parkview Drive, Decatur, GA 30033
- **Year Built:** 1998, renovated 2018
- **Units:** 50 (mix of 1BR and 2BR)
- **Current Occupancy:** 92%
- **Asking Price:** $4,200,000
- **Listed Cap Rate:** 6.8%

## What We Need
1. Verify the stated cap rate against actual T12 financials
2. Pull comps for similar properties within 5 miles
3. Assess whether current rents are at, above, or below market
4. Review the rent roll for lease expiration concentration
5. Score the deal on risk and recommend go/no-go
6. Build due diligence checklist and track document collection

## Key Questions
- Is there rent upside? Can we push rents 10-15% after light renovation?
- What's the deferred maintenance exposure?
- Are there any environmental or zoning concerns?
- What does the exit look like in 5 years at current cap rate trends?

## Budget
- Acquisition: $4.2M (target: negotiate to $3.8-4.0M)
- Renovation budget: $500K ($10K/unit for interior refresh)
- Target stabilized NOI: $350K+ (8%+ return on cost)
