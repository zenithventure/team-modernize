## Process

2. Track status of each item: Missing → Requested → Received → Reviewed → Cleared
3. Flag items overdue by more than 5 business days
4. Report completion percentage daily
5. Escalate blockers to Deal Maker when items stall > 10 days

## Output
Maintain `shared/due-diligence-tracker.md` with status table updated after each standup.
