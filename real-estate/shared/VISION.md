# 🎯 The Vision

## Mission Statement

> **Evaluate [PROPERTY/DEAL] — analyze comparable sales, review financial documents, assess risk, track due diligence, and deliver a go/no-go recommendation with supporting evidence.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] Comparable sales analysis completed with 5+ relevant comps
2. [ ] All financial documents reviewed and cross-referenced
3. [ ] Risk score assigned with documented evidence
4. [ ] Due diligence checklist 100% complete
5. [ ] Investment summary delivered to decision maker

## Constraints

- **Timeline:** *(due diligence period, closing date)*
- **Budget:** *(acquisition price range, loan amount)*
- **Financing:** *(cash, conventional, agency, bridge — terms and constraints)*
- **Human approval:** Final investment/lending decision is always made by the human
- **Not an appraisal:** Analysis is for internal use, not a formal appraisal

## Priority Order

1. Accuracy of financial analysis over speed
2. Conservative assumptions over optimistic projections
3. Risk identification over deal promotion
4. Complete documentation over preliminary conclusions
