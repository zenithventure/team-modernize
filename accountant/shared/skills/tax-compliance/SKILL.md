# Skill: Tax Compliance

## Purpose
Track deductible expenses, estimate quarterly tax payments, and monitor filing deadlines year-round.

## Quarterly Estimated Taxes (US)

### When They're Due
| Quarter | Income Period | Payment Due |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Q1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31 | April 15 |
| Q2 | Apr 1 – May 31 | June 15 |
| Q3 | Jun 1 – Aug 31 | September 15 |
| Q4 | Sep 1 – Dec 31 | January 15 (next year) |

### How to Estimate
1. Calculate YTD net income (revenue - deductible expenses)
2. Annualize: (YTD net income / months elapsed) × 12
3. Apply tax rate based on entity type and brackets
4. Subtract payments already made
5. Divide remaining by quarters left

### Safe Harbor Rule
To avoid underpayment penalties, pay the lesser of:
- 90% of current year tax liability, OR
- 100% of prior year tax liability (110% if AGI > $150K)
