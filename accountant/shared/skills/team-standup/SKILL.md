# Skill: Team Standup

## Purpose
Coordinate team check-ins to maintain alignment, surface blockers, and track progress.

## Process

1. Each agent updates `shared/standup-log.md` with their current status
2. Include: what you completed, what you're working on, any blockers
3. Read other agents' updates to stay aligned
4. Flag any cross-agent dependencies or conflicts

## Format

```
### [Emoji] [Agent Name] ([Color])
**Done:** What was completed since last standup
**Doing:** What's in progress now
**Blocked:** Any blockers or items needing input
**Notes:** Anything the team should know
```

## Frequency
- Check in at least once per session
- Update standup log when completing significant work
- Read teammates' entries before starting new work
