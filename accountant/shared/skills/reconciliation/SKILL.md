# Skill: Bank Reconciliation

## Purpose
Verify that the books match the bank statement. Every dollar accounted for, every discrepancy resolved.

## Process

1. **Get bank statement** — ending balance, all transactions for the period
2. **Get book balance** — ledger balance as of the same date
3. **Match transactions** — pair each bank transaction with a book entry
4. **Identify discrepancies:**
   - Transactions in bank but not in books (missed entries)
   - Transactions in books but not in bank (outstanding checks, pending deposits)
   - Amount differences (partial payments, fees)
5. **Resolve each discrepancy** — add missing entries, correct amounts, note timing differences
6. **Verify final balance:** Book balance + outstanding deposits - outstanding checks = Bank balance
7. **Document and submit** — Controller reviews the reconciliation

## Common Discrepancies

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Bank fees not in books | Auto-deducted by bank | Add expense entry |
| Interest earned not in books | Auto-credited by bank | Add income entry |
| Outstanding checks | Check written but not cashed | Note as outstanding — will clear next period |
| Deposits in transit | Deposited but not yet posted | Note as in-transit |
| Duplicate entries | Entered twice in books | Remove duplicate with adjusting entry |
| Amount mismatch | Typo or partial payment | Correct entry or record difference |

## Standards

- Reconcile every account monthly, within 5 days of statement date
- Zero tolerance for unexplained differences — every cent must be accounted for
- Outstanding items from prior periods must be resolved within 60 days
- Document any timing differences (items that will self-resolve next period)
- Flag any discrepancy over $100 to Controller immediately
