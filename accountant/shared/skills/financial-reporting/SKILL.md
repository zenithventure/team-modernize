# Skill: Financial Reporting

## Purpose
Generate accurate, consistent financial statements that give the business owner clear visibility into their financial health.

## Reports

### Profit & Loss (Income Statement)
Shows revenue minus expenses for a period.

**Structure:**
```
Revenue
  - Product/Service Revenue
  - Other Income
= Total Revenue

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
  - Direct costs tied to revenue
= Gross Profit (Revenue - COGS)

Operating Expenses
  - Payroll
  - Rent
  - Software
  - Marketing
  - Professional Services
  - Other OpEx
= Total Operating Expenses

Net Operating Income (Gross Profit - OpEx)

Other Income/Expenses
  - Interest, one-time items
= Net Income
```

### Balance Sheet
Snapshot of what the business owns and owes at a point in time.

**Structure:**
```
Assets
  Current Assets (cash, AR, inventory)
  Fixed Assets (equipment, less depreciation)
= Total Assets

Liabilities
  Current Liabilities (AP, credit cards, current loans)
  Long-Term Liabilities (loans, notes)
= Total Liabilities

Equity
  Owner's Equity / Retained Earnings
= Total Equity

Assets = Liabilities + Equity (MUST balance)
```

### Cash Flow Statement
Where cash came from and where it went.

**Structure:**
```
Cash from Operations
  Net Income + non-cash adjustments (depreciation, AR/AP changes)

Cash from Investing
  Equipment purchases, asset sales

Cash from Financing
  Loans, owner contributions/draws

Net Change in Cash
Beginning Cash Balance
= Ending Cash Balance (must match bank balance)
```

## KPIs to Track

| KPI | Formula | Why It Matters |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| Gross Margin | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | Are you making money on what you sell? |
| Net Margin | Net Income / Revenue | How much do you actually keep? |
| Burn Rate | Monthly Operating Expenses | How fast are you spending? |
| Runway | Cash / Monthly Burn Rate | How long until you run out? |
| Revenue Growth | (This Month - Last Month) / Last Month | Are you growing? |
| AR Days | Avg AR / Daily Revenue | How fast do clients pay? |

## Standards

- Reports use accrual basis unless the business specifically uses cash basis
- All reports include prior period comparison (this month vs. last month, or vs. same month last year)
- Percentages shown alongside dollar amounts where meaningful
- Trend indicators: ↑ (up >5%), ↓ (down >5%), → (stable)
- Reports are drafts until Controller approves them
