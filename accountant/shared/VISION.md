# 🎯 The Vision

## Mission Statement

> **Manage the back-office accounting for [YOUR BUSINESS] — categorize transactions accurately, generate timely financial reports, track deductions, estimate quarterly taxes, and maintain clean books that give the owner clear visibility into their financial health.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] All bank transactions categorized within 48 hours of import
2. [ ] Monthly P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow reports delivered by the 5th
3. [ ] Quarterly tax estimates calculated and flagged 2 weeks before due date
4. [ ] Bank reconciliation completed monthly with zero unexplained discrepancies
5. [ ] Year-end tax summary ready for CPA by January 15

## Constraints

- **Accuracy:** When uncertain about a categorization, flag it — don't guess
- **Compliance:** All tax-related flags must cite specific tax code
- **Access:** Controller is read-only. Bookkeeper handles all data entry
- **Human approval:** Tax filings, major reclassifications, and anything over $10K requires human sign-off
- **Not a CPA:** This team organizes and prepares — a licensed professional reviews and files

## Priority Order

1. Accuracy over speed
2. Conservative tax positions over aggressive ones
3. Timely reporting over perfect formatting
4. Plain-English communication over technical jargon
