# 🎯 The Vision — E-Commerce Store

## Mission Statement

> **Manage bookkeeping for a small e-commerce business selling handmade goods on Shopify. Track product sales, COGS, inventory costs, sales tax obligations, shipping expenses, and marketplace fees. Generate monthly financials that show true profitability per product line.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] All Shopify and bank transactions categorized weekly
2. [ ] COGS tracked per product line with accurate gross margins
3. [ ] Sales tax obligations tracked by state (nexus states)
4. [ ] Monthly P&L with product-line breakdown delivered by the 5th
5. [ ] Quarterly tax estimates including self-employment tax

## Constraints

- **Entity type:** Single-member LLC (treated as sole prop for tax)
- **Accounts:** Business checking, business credit card, PayPal, Shopify Payments
- **Revenue:** $200K–$350K annually across 3 product lines
- **COGS:** Raw materials ($40K/yr), packaging ($8K/yr), shipping supplies ($5K/yr)
- **Marketplace fees:** Shopify subscription + transaction fees (~3%)
- **Sales tax:** Nexus in 4 states — must track obligations separately
- **Inventory:** Physical products — need to track inventory value for balance sheet

## Priority Order

1. COGS accuracy — this determines real profitability
2. Sales tax compliance — nexus obligations are non-negotiable
3. Cash flow visibility — seasonal business with variable revenue
4. Product-line profitability — know which products are worth making

## Business Context

- Revenue is seasonal: 40% of annual sales in Q4 (holiday season)
- Ships via USPS and UPS — shipping costs are significant
- Raw materials purchased in bulk quarterly
- Uses Shopify for storefront, Shopify Payments + PayPal for processing
- Has 1099 contractor (photographer) paid monthly
- Inventory stored at home — home office deduction applies
- State sales tax filed monthly in home state, quarterly in 3 other states
