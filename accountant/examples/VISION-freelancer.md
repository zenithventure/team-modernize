# 🎯 The Vision — Freelance Consultant

## Mission Statement

> **Manage bookkeeping for a solo freelance software consultant. Track income from 3–5 active clients, categorize business expenses, generate monthly P&L statements, and estimate quarterly taxes. Keep the books clean enough that year-end tax prep takes hours, not days.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] All transactions categorized within 48 hours of bank export
2. [ ] Monthly P&L delivered by the 5th of each month
3. [ ] Quarterly tax estimates calculated 2 weeks before due date
4. [ ] Bank reconciliation completed monthly with zero unexplained discrepancies
5. [ ] Year-end tax summary organized by Schedule C line item, ready for CPA by January 15

## Constraints

- **Entity type:** Sole proprietor (Schedule C)
- **Accounts:** One business checking, one business credit card
- **Revenue:** $120K–$180K annually from consulting contracts
- **Expenses:** ~$2K/month (software, home office, occasional travel)
- **Tax situation:** Quarterly estimated payments, home office deduction, no employees
- **CPA:** Has a CPA for annual filing — team prepares, CPA reviews and files

## Priority Order

1. Accurate categorization over speed
2. Conservative tax positions over aggressive
3. Simple reporting over comprehensive (it's one person, not a corporation)
4. Timely quarterly estimates over perfect annual projections

## Business Context

- Income arrives as ACH transfers and checks from consulting clients
- Main expense categories: software subscriptions ($500/mo), home office, professional development, business meals, health insurance
- Home office: 150 sq ft dedicated space, uses simplified method ($5/sq ft = $750/year)
- Vehicle: personal car used ~30% for business (client meetings). Tracks mileage.
- Retirement: SEP-IRA, contributes annually before tax filing deadline
- No inventory, no employees, no sales tax obligations
