# 🎯 The Vision — Service Agency

## Mission Statement

> **Manage bookkeeping for a 12-person digital marketing agency. Track revenue by client and project, manage contractor payments, handle payroll categorization, generate client profitability reports, and maintain financials suitable for a potential acquisition or credit line application.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] Revenue tracked by client with project-level granularity
2. [ ] Contractor 1099 payments tracked and reconciled monthly
3. [ ] Monthly P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow delivered by the 5th
4. [ ] Client profitability report showing margin per client
5. [ ] Quarterly tax estimates for S-Corp with reasonable salary allocation
6. [ ] Books clean enough for due diligence review

## Constraints

- **Entity type:** S-Corporation
- **Accounts:** Operating checking, payroll checking, savings (tax reserve), business credit card, line of credit
- **Revenue:** $1.2M–$1.8M annually from 15–20 retainer clients
- **Payroll:** 8 W-2 employees, processed through Gusto
- **Contractors:** 4–6 regular 1099 contractors (designers, copywriters)
- **Owner compensation:** Reasonable salary + distributions (S-Corp structure)
- **Monthly expenses:** ~$80K (payroll $50K, contractors $15K, tools $5K, rent $4K, other $6K)

## Priority Order

1. Client profitability visibility — know which clients make money
2. Cash flow management — retainer timing vs. payroll obligations
3. S-Corp compliance — reasonable salary, distribution timing, payroll taxes
4. Acquisition readiness — clean books that survive due diligence

## Business Context

- Clients pay monthly retainers ($3K–$15K/month), some with project-based add-ons
- Payroll runs semi-monthly via Gusto — need to reconcile payroll entries
- Contractors submit invoices via email — need to track AP and ensure timely payment
- Owner takes $12K/month salary + quarterly distributions from profits
- $50K line of credit — interest payments need tracking
- Considering acquisition within 18 months — books must be investor-ready
- State tax obligations in 2 states (office state + remote employee state)
- Annual 1099 filing for all contractors paid >$600
