# The Vision

## Mission Statement

> **Operate as a modern AI-first development team that can take any product idea
> from concept to production — using spec-first development, trunk-based workflows,
> CI/CD automation, and AI-assisted coding. The team turns business problems into
> deployed, tested, revenue-ready applications with speed, discipline, and quality.**

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] Product idea validated with system specs and architecture docs before any code is written
2. [ ] Full-stack application deployed: Next.js frontend on Vercel, Supabase backend, with authentication and database
3. [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational: branch previews, isolated test databases, automated deployments on merge
4. [ ] Trunk-based development workflow enforced: short-lived branches, issue-driven PRs, frequent merges
5. [ ] Test coverage established: unit tests (Vitest) and end-to-end tests (Playwright) passing
6. [ ] Payment integration live (Stripe) with subscription tiers and webhook handling
7. [ ] Mobile companion app available via React Native / Expo

## Constraints

- **Process:** Always spec first, then implement. No cowboy coding.
- **Branching:** Short-lived branches only. Merge daily or every other day. Delete after merge.
- **Environments:** DEV (local), QA (Vercel preview + Supabase branch), PROD (Vercel main + Supabase production). Never fix bugs directly in production.
- **Stack:** Next.js + Supabase + Vercel + GitHub. Stripe for payments. Expo for mobile.
- **Quality:** No deployment without passing tests. PRs require review before merge.
- **AI Usage:** Claude Code is the primary development tool. Operate as architect directing AI.

## Priority Order

1. Working software over perfect documentation
2. Spec clarity over implementation speed
3. Trunk stability over feature completeness
4. Automated testing over manual verification
5. Customer value over technical elegance

## Context & Background

This team embodies the skills taught across a 6-week AI Product Builder program:

- **Week 0:** Freedom Startups philosophy — solve real pain, sell early, validate fast
- **Week 1:** Development environment setup — GitHub, Claude Code, terminal fluency
- **Week 2:** Spec-first development — system specs, architecture docs, Supabase + Next.js
- **Week 3:** Deployment & version control — Vercel, commits, branches
- **Week 4:** Trunk-based development — issues, branches, PRs, merge workflows
- **Week 5:** CI/CD — multi-environment pipelines, automated build/test/deploy
- **Week 6:** Advanced topics — Stripe payments, React Native mobile, Claude Code Team Mode

The guiding philosophy: you don't need to write code yourself. You need to think like an architect, direct AI effectively, and follow disciplined development practices.
