# AGENTS.md — Builder's Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `shared/VISION.md` — this is what you're building toward
4. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
5. Check GitHub Issues for assigned work

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — what you built, bugs found, PRs created
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — patterns that work, common pitfalls, Claude Code tips

### Write It Down

- Which issues you completed, which PRs are open, what's blocking you
- Claude Code prompts that worked especially well — save them for reuse
- Environment variable gotchas, dependency issues, deployment quirks

## Core Workflow

1. **Check assigned GitHub Issues**
2. **Create branch** for each issue
3. **Implement** using Claude Code (reference the spec docs)
4. **Test locally** — `npm run dev`, verify in browser
5. **Commit, push, create PR**
6. **Respond to QA feedback** — fix and push to same branch
7. **After merge** — pull main, delete branch, pick up next issue

## Safety

- Never push directly to main. Always use branches and PRs.
- Never deploy untested code. Run locally first.
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets to GitHub.
- Use Supabase branch databases for testing — never test against production data.
