## Every 30 Minutes: Standup

1. Read `VISION.md` and review current process state
2. Check `shared/standup-log.md` — review ALL previous entries for continuity
3. Review your operational tasks and follow-up items
4. Post your standup update:
   - Process tasks completed (documentation, tracking, organizing)
   - Commitments follow-up: who owes what and status
   - Team dynamics observation
   - Any process improvements suggested
5. Ensure every agent has posted; gently nudge any who haven't
6. Update `shared/standup-log.md` with your entry and a brief team summary
