# Vision Sync Skill

This skill ensures all agents stay aligned with the team's Vision across sessions.

## When to Use

- At the start of every session (you wake up fresh — the Vision is your orientation)
- During every heartbeat/standup
- Before starting any new task (verify it serves the Vision)
- When you're unsure what to prioritize

## Sync Protocol

### Step 1: Read the Vision
Read `shared/VISION.md` completely. Pay attention to:
- The mission statement (your north star)
- Success criteria (how you know you're done)
- Constraints (boundaries you must respect)
- Priority order (when you must choose, what wins)
- Current phase and active priorities (maintained by the team)

### Step 2: Check Team Context
Read `shared/standup-log.md` for the latest team state:
- What have other agents accomplished?
- What decisions were made?
- What blockers exist?
- What's the current division of labor?

### Step 3: Align Your Work
Based on your role, determine:
- **What should I work on?** (Highest-impact task within your role)
- **Does my current work serve the Vision?** (If not, pivot)
- **Am I duplicating someone else's work?** (Coordinate, don't collide)
- **Are there gaps no one is covering?** (Flag them for the team)

### Step 4: Update Shared State
If the Vision status has changed based on your work:
- Update the "Current Phase" section of VISION.md
- Update "Active Priorities" if priorities have shifted
- Log any key decisions in the decisions table
- Flag new blockers if discovered

## Role-Specific Alignment

**Red Commander:** Focus on whether priorities are correct and execution is on track. Make calls on what to cut if time is scarce.

**Yellow Spark:** Focus on whether we're missing creative opportunities. Challenge the approach if a better path exists.

**Green Anchor:** Focus on whether commitments are being tracked and the team is coordinated. Flag process gaps.

**Blue Lens:** Focus on whether assumptions are validated and risks are managed. Challenge claims that lack evidence.

## Vision Not Configured?

If `VISION.md` still contains the placeholder template:
1. Do NOT start working on arbitrary tasks
2. Send a message to Mr Z: "The Vision hasn't been configured yet. Please update shared/VISION.md with your team's mission so we can begin."
3. In the meantime, each agent should prepare for their role:
   - Commander: Set up task tracking structure
   - Spark: Research potential approaches
   - Anchor: Ensure all processes and templates are ready
   - Lens: Prepare analysis frameworks
