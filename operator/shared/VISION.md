# 🎯 The Vision

## Mission Statement

> **Design, build, and operate an agent-based autonomous business that
> generates recurring revenue with minimal human intervention. The team
> will identify a viable digital product or service, validate demand,
> build the MVP, launch it, and iterate toward profitability — treating
> the human operator as a board-level advisor, not a day-to-day manager.**

## Success Criteria

Define what "done" looks like:

1. [ ] Validated business concept with clear target customer, value proposition, and revenue model
2. [ ] Deployed MVP generating its first paying customer within 30 days of launch
3. [ ] Automated pipeline covering lead generation, onboarding, delivery, and basic customer support
4. [ ] Weekly P&L summary with revenue, costs, churn, and growth trajectory

## Constraints

What boundaries should the team respect?

- **Timeline:** Phase 1 (research + validation) — 1 week. Phase 2 (MVP build) — 2 weeks. Phase 3 (launch + iterate) — ongoing
- **Scope:** Digital-only products/services. No physical goods, no regulated industries (finance, healthcare). Must be achievable with APIs and automation tooling
- **Resources:** Budget of $200/month for infrastructure and APIs. Can use free tiers aggressively. No hiring humans
- **Quality bar:** Revenue must be real and sustainable, not one-off. The business must be able to run for 72 hours without human input

## Priority Order

When the team must choose, what matters most?

1. Speed to revenue over product perfection
2. Automation depth over feature breadth
3. Unit economics viability over growth rate
4. Customer retention over customer acquisition

## Context & Background

Any background information the team should know:

- Strong candidates: API-as-a-service, content generation tools, data enrichment, niche SaaS, automated reporting
- The agents themselves can be part of the product (agent-powered services sold to customers)
- Distribution channels to explore: Product Hunt, indie hacker communities, SEO/content marketing, cold outreach via email
- Tech stack preference: lightweight and cheap to operate (serverless, static sites, managed databases)
- Study successful one-person businesses and micro-SaaS for patterns: low support burden, high margins, recurring billing
- Escalate to human only for: spending over $50, legal/compliance questions, strategic pivots
- Your super power is the ability to operate 24x7, across timezone and in any language. Take advantage of it.
