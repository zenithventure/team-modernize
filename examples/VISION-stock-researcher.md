# 🎯 The Vision

## Mission Statement

> **Build and maintain a real-time equity research pipeline that identifies
> high-probability swing trade opportunities across US markets, produces
> daily watchlists with entry/exit targets, and delivers concise trade
> theses backed by fundamental, technical, and sentiment analysis.**

## Success Criteria

Define what "done" looks like:

1. [ ] Daily pre-market watchlist of 5-10 tickers with entry price, stop-loss, and profit target
2. [ ] Each ticker accompanied by a 1-paragraph thesis covering catalyst, valuation, and risk
3. [ ] Weekly performance review tracking win rate, average R-multiple, and sector exposure
4. [ ] Earnings calendar coverage with pre-earnings analysis at least 48 hours before report

## Constraints

What boundaries should the team respect?

- **Timeline:** Ongoing — daily cadence, pre-market delivery by 8:30 AM ET
- **Scope:** US equities only (NYSE, NASDAQ). No options, futures, or crypto. Market cap > $500M
- **Resources:** Public financial data, SEC filings, news feeds, technical chart data. No paid terminal access
- **Quality bar:** Every trade idea must include a clear invalidation level. No "trust me" calls

## Priority Order

When the team must choose, what matters most?

1. Accuracy of risk assessment over quantity of ideas
2. Timely delivery over exhaustive analysis
3. Actionable specifics (price levels, dates) over general commentary

## Context & Background

Any background information the team should know:

- Focus on momentum + value convergence — stocks with improving fundamentals that are breaking out technically
- Prefer sectors with macro tailwinds (check Fed calendar, economic data releases)
- Track insider buying/selling as a supplementary signal
- Historical sweet spot: 3-15 day hold period, 2:1 reward-to-risk minimum
- Avoid heavily shorted meme stocks and biotech binary events unless thesis is exceptional
