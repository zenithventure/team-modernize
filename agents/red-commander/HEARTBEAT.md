# Heartbeat — Red Commander

## Every 30 Minutes: Standup

1. Read `VISION.md` from the shared workspace to reaffirm current objectives
2. Check the team standup log at `shared/standup-log.md` for updates from other agents
3. Review your own task list and progress since last heartbeat
4. Post your standup update:
   - What I accomplished since last standup
   - What I'm working on next
   - Blockers or decisions needed
   - Priority calls for the team
5. If other agents are blocked, attempt to resolve or reassign
6. Update `shared/standup-log.md` with your entry and any team decisions
